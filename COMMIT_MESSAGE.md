# Comprehensive Email Configuration and Documentation Enhancement

## Summary
This commit implements a complete email configuration system for the GSCMS project, enabling production-ready SMTP functionality with shared hosting support, and provides extensive documentation updates to enhance project understanding and deployment capabilities.

## Email System Implementation

### SMTP Configuration Setup
- **Configured shared hosting email integration** with client settings for `admin@gscms.vuyanimagibisela.co.za`
- **Updated .env files** in both main project and `local_deployment_prep/` directory with production SMTP settings:
  - Host: `gscms.vuyanimagibisela.co.za`
  - Port: `465` (SSL encryption)
  - Authentication: SSL/TLS with proper security settings
- **Enhanced mail.php configuration** with comprehensive SMTP settings including:
  - Proper port type casting for integer values
  - Enhanced authentication modes (PLAIN, LOGIN, CRAM-MD5)
  - Reply-To address configuration
  - Email logging path specification
  - SSL/TLS security settings with peer verification

### Email Template and Feature Enhancements
- **Added additional email templates** for:
  - Registration confirmation emails
  - Team approval notifications
  - Enhanced welcome and password reset templates
- **Implemented email security settings** including:
  - Peer verification enabled
  - SSL certificate validation
