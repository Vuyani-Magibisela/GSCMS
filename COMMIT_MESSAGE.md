fix: resolve production deployment issues and implement comprehensive deployment framework

## Summary
This commit resolves critical production deployment issues identified during shared hosting deployment and implements a comprehensive deployment framework with documentation, tooling, and best practices to ensure seamless future deployments.

## Major Issues Resolved

### 1. Session Management & Header Issues
- **Fixed**: Session configuration errors causing "headers already sent" warnings
- **Modified**: `app/Core/Session.php` - Added `!headers_sent()` checks before session configuration
- **Modified**: `app/bootstrap.php` - Added header safety checks for session initialization
- **Impact**: Eliminates 500 errors during session startup in production environments

### 2. View Rendering & Output Buffering
- **Fixed**: Critical output buffering issues in view files causing 500 errors
- **Modified**: All view files to implement proper output buffering pattern:
  - `app/Views/auth/login.php`
  - `app/Views/auth/register.php`
  - `app/Views/auth/forgot_password.php`
  - `app/Views/auth/reset_password.php`
  - `app/Views/auth/change_password.php`
  - `app/Views/dashboard/index.php`
  - `app/Views/emails/welcome.php`
  - `app/Views/emails/password_reset.php`
- **Pattern**: Replace `$content = ob_get_clean(); ob_start();` with `ob_start();`
- **Impact**: Resolves all view rendering 500 errors in production

### 3. Model Static Method Implementation
- **Fixed**: Missing static methods in BaseModel causing User::find() failures
- **Modified**: `app/Models/BaseModel.php` - Added static `find()` method alongside instance method
- **Added**: Both `User::find($id)` (static) and `$user->findInstance($id)` (instance) support
- **Impact**: Enables proper model querying as expected by controllers and authentication system

### 4. Helper Functions Framework
- **Added**: `app/Core/helpers.php` - Comprehensive helper function library
- **Functions**: `storage_path()`, `app_path()`, `config_path()`, `public_path()`, `asset()`, `url()`, `route()`, `old()`, `csrf_token()`, `csrf_field()`, `dd()`, `env()`
- **Integration**: Loaded in bootstrap for global availability
- **Impact**: Provides essential utility functions required by views and controllers

## Deployment Framework Implementation

### 1. Production Configuration Management
- **Added**: Production-ready database configuration with proper credentials
- **Added**: Production app configuration with security settings, timezone, and environment-specific settings
- **Security**: Debug mode disabled, error reporting configured for production
- **Features**: Session security, CSRF protection, file upload restrictions, admin email configuration

### 2. Database Migration & Seeding
- **Created**: `schema_hosting.sql` - Shared hosting compatible database schema (no CREATE DATABASE)
- **Created**: `seeds_clean.sql` - Clean production seed data with proper enum values and no duplicates
- **Fixed**: Column name mismatches (e.g., `phase_number` vs `order_sequence`)
- **Verified**: Database structure compatibility with hosting environments

### 3. Web Server Configuration
- **Created**: Production-ready .htaccess configurations for both root and public directories
- **Features**: Security headers, file access restrictions, URL rewriting, compression, caching
- **Compatibility**: Simplified versions for problematic hosting environments
- **Security**: Blocks access to sensitive directories and files

### 4. Deployment Tooling & Automation
- **Structure**: Complete deployment package in organized directory structure
- **Verification**: Comprehensive diagnostic and testing tools for troubleshooting
- **Documentation**: Step-by-step deployment instructions and troubleshooting guides

## Documentation & Guidelines

### 1. Enhanced CLAUDE.md
- **Added**: Complete "Production Deployment" section with:
  - Shared hosting deployment procedures
  - Common deployment issues and solutions
  - Security considerations and best practices
  - Deployment checklist and troubleshooting guide
  - Maintenance and monitoring procedures
- **Coverage**: Session management, view rendering, model patterns, URL rewriting
- **Future-proofing**: Guidelines to prevent similar issues in future deployments

### 2. Repository Management
- **Added**: `.gitignore` - Comprehensive exclusion rules for PHP applications
- **Protected**: Configuration files, logs, uploads, temporary files, IDE files
- **Critical**: Excludes `local_deployment_prep/` directory containing production credentials
- **Security**: Prevents accidental commit of sensitive deployment data

## Testing & Verification
- **Created**: Multiple diagnostic tools for troubleshooting deployment issues
- **Verified**: All critical application components work in production environment
- **Tested**: User authentication, session management, database connectivity, view rendering
- **Confirmed**: Main application routes functional (login, dashboard, home)

## Security Enhancements
- **Credentials**: Production database configuration with proper access controls
- **Sessions**: Secure session configuration with httponly, secure, and samesite settings
- **Headers**: Security headers including XSS protection, content type options, frame options
- **Access Control**: Directory restrictions and file access limitations via .htaccess
- **Error Handling**: Production error handling that doesn't expose sensitive information

## Performance Optimizations
- **Compression**: Enabled gzip compression for static assets
- **Caching**: Browser caching headers for CSS, JS, and images
- **Output Buffering**: Proper output buffering implementation prevents premature header sending
- **Session Optimization**: Efficient session management with proper lifecycle handling
