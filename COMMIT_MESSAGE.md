# Comprehensive RBAC System Implementation

## Summary
Implement complete Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system with comprehensive permission management, middleware protection, and resource ownership validation for the GSCMS application.

## Major Features Added

### üîê Enhanced Authentication & Authorization System
- **Enhanced Auth Class** (`app/Core/Auth.php`)
  - Added comprehensive permission constants for all system actions
  - Implemented role hierarchy with numerical levels (Participant=1 to Super Admin=6)
  - Created role-permission mapping for granular access control
  - Added permission checking methods: `hasPermission()`, `hasAnyPermission()`, `hasAllPermissions()`
  - Implemented resource ownership validation: `ownsResource()`, `canAccess()`, `canManage()`
  - Added role management methods: `getPermissions()`, `getRoleLevel()`, `getManageableRoles()`

### üõ°Ô∏è Middleware Protection System
- **AuthMiddleware** (`app/Core/Middleware/AuthMiddleware.php`)
  - Ensures user authentication with proper redirects
  - Handles JSON responses for API endpoints
  - Stores intended URL for post-login redirection

- **RoleMiddleware** (`app/Core/Middleware/RoleMiddleware.php`)
  - Validates user roles with parameter support (`role:super_admin,competition_admin`)
  - Supports multiple role requirements
  - Proper error handling with contextual redirects

- **PermissionMiddleware** (`app/Core/Middleware/PermissionMiddleware.php`)
  - Checks specific permissions (`permission:user.manage,school.view`)
  - Supports granular permission-based access control
  - Flexible permission requirement handling

- **Enhanced Router** (`app/Core/Router.php`)
  - Updated middleware system to handle parameters
  - Improved middleware resolution with fallback paths
  - Support for complex middleware chaining

### üë§ Enhanced User Model
- **User Model Extensions** (`app/Models/User.php`)
  - Added comprehensive permission checking methods
  - Implemented role hierarchy validation
  - Created convenience methods for specific role checks
  - Added resource ownership delegation to Auth class

### üéõÔ∏è Controller Base Enhancements
- **BaseController Extensions** (`app/Controllers/BaseController.php`)
  - Added comprehensive permission checking methods
  - Implemented resource ownership validation helpers
  - Added proper error handling with contextual redirects
  - Integrated RBAC methods throughout controller layer

### üé® View Helper System
- **ViewHelpers Class** (`app/Core/ViewHelpers.php`)
  - Template helper functions for role/permission checking
  - Conditional content rendering (`ifRole`, `ifPermission`, `ifAuth`)
  - Dynamic navigation generation based on user permissions
  - Active page detection and CSS class helpers

- **Enhanced Helper Functions** (`app/Core/helpers.php`)
  - Global helper functions for easy template usage
  - Role and permission checking shortcuts
  - User information and display helpers
  - Navigation and UI state management

### üõ£Ô∏è Comprehensive Route Protection
- **Complete Route Restructuring** (`routes/web.php`)
  - Implemented role-based route groups with proper middleware
  - Added permission-based route protection
  - Organized routes by user roles and access levels
  - Protected API endpoints with appropriate permissions
  - Maintained backwards compatibility with existing routes

## Role Hierarchy Implemented

```
Super Admin (Level 6)         ‚Üí Full system access, user management, system config
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Competition Admin (Level 5) ‚Üí Competition management, judge assignment, reporting  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ School Coordinator (Level 4) ‚Üí School teams, participant registration, documents
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Judge (Level 3)            ‚Üí Scoring interface, assigned competitions only
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Team Coach (Level 2)       ‚Üí Team details, participant info (limited scope)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Participant (Level 1)      ‚Üí Profile management, view team info
```

## Permission System Implemented

### System Permissions
- `system.admin` - Full system administration access
- `user.manage` - User creation, editing, and management
- `competition.manage` - Competition setup and management
- `competition.view` - View competition information
- `school.manage` - School administration and coordination
- `school.view` - View school information
- `team.manage` - Team creation and management
- `team.view` - View team information
- `judge.manage` - Judge assignment and management
- `judge.score` - Access to scoring interfaces
- `participant.manage` - Participant registration and management
- `participant.view` - View participant information
- `report.view` - Access to system reports
- `report.export` - Export report data

### Resource Ownership Controls
- School coordinators limited to their assigned schools
- Team coaches restricted to their assigned teams
- Judges can only score assigned competitions
- Participants can only view their team information
- Automatic resource boundary enforcement

## Route Protection Examples

### Role-Based Protection
```php
// Super Admin only routes
$router->group(['middleware' => 'role:super_admin'], function($router) {
    $router->get('/admin/system', 'Admin\SystemController@index');
});

// Multiple role access
$router->group(['middleware' => 'role:competition_admin,super_admin'], function($router) {
    $router->get('/admin/competitions', 'Admin\CompetitionController@index');
});
```

### Permission-Based Protection
```php
// Specific permission required
$router->group(['middleware' => 'permission:user.manage'], function($router) {
    $router->get('/users/manage', 'UserManagementController@index');
});

// Multiple permissions (user must have ALL)
$router->group(['middleware' => 'permission:competition.manage,judge.manage'], function($router) {
    $router->get('/admin/competition-judging', 'Admin\CompetitionJudgingController@index');
});
```

### Controller Usage
```php
public function index()
{
    // Check permissions in controller
    $this->requirePermission(Auth::PERM_USER_MANAGE);
    
    // Verify resource ownership
    $this->requireResourceOwnership('school', $schoolId);
    
    return $this->view('admin.users.index');
}
```

### View Template Usage
```php
<?php if (hasRole('super_admin')): ?>
    <a href="/admin/system">System Admin</a>
<?php endif; ?>

<?= ifPermission('user.manage', '<button>Manage Users</button>') ?>

<p>Welcome, <?= userName() ?> (<?= roleDisplayName() ?>)</p>
```
