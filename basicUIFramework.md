Basic UI Framework
1. Integrate Modern CSS with Responsive Design

Choose CSS framework: Bootstrap 5, Tailwind CSS, or custom CSS system
Set up responsive grid system and breakpoints
Implement modern design tokens (colors, typography, spacing)
Add CSS custom properties for theming and consistency
Include responsive utilities and component classes

2. Create Base Layout Templates
// Three main layouts needed:
app/Views/layouts/app.php      → Authenticated user interface
app/Views/layouts/public.php   → Public-facing pages (home, info)
app/Views/layouts/admin.php    → Administrative interface

app.php: Dashboard layout with sidebar navigation, user menu
public.php: Marketing/info layout with top navigation, footer
admin.php: Data-heavy layout with admin sidebar, breadcrumbs

3. Header, Footer, and Navigation Partials
// Reusable components:
app/Views/partials/_header.php        → Site header with logo, main nav
app/Views/partials/_footer.php        → Site footer with links, copyright
app/Views/partials/_admin_sidebar.php → Admin navigation menu
app/Views/partials/_user_menu.php     → User dropdown menu
app/Views/partials/_breadcrumbs.php   → Navigation breadcrumbs

4. CSS/JS Asset Management

Organize assets in public/css/ and public/js/
Create asset helper functions for cache-busting
Set up asset compilation/minification (optional)
Implement responsive image handling
Add icon system (FontAwesome, Feather Icons, or custom)

Implementation Structure:

├── css/
│   ├── style.css            → Main application styles
│   ├── admin.css            → Admin-specific styles
│   └── components.css       → Reusable component styles
├── js/
│   ├── .js 		    → GSAP JS
│   ├── main.js             → Application JS
