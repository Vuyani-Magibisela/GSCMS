### GDE SCIBOTICS 2025

**INTRODUCTION**

Practical competition challenge activities help the participants to learn about robotics and coding with
absolutely no difficulty because it’s exciting and fun. GDE SCIBOTICS Competition exposes youth from
underserviced communities to engineering problem solving and exciting challenges.

The competition takes place every year in September, and it’s called GDE SciBOTICS because it’s all
about science fiction. Remember, what’s impossible today often becomes the reality of tomorrow. In
1903 when the Wright brothers made their first flight at Kitty Hawk North Carolina, USA, some believed
it would take another 1000 years for humans to learn how to fly ... who would have thought humans
would land on the Moon a few short decades later and send equipment to explore Mars?

We want you to think about living in entirely new realms, our large scale models of colonies in space
on distant planets are designed to get you, the learner, to start thinking about what might be needed
to survive far away from our home planet, and what we can do to live sustainably on Earth.

The Gauteng Department of Education SciBOTICS Competition at Sci-Bono Discovery Centre, has been
designed to touch your life in a positive way with benefits that will help you right through your tertiary
education. We hope to see you at the GDE SciBOTICS in 2025, a competition that is quickly going to
become the most important STEM education event of the year. What you learn by participating in
SCIBOTICS will open doors for you, and could be the key to your exciting maths and science career.

Benefits of getting involved in the GDE SCIBOTICS competition:

- You will experience writing and uploading program code from a computer to a robot.
- You will build and program a world class Arduino robot from electronic parts.
- You will participate in an exciting robotics challenge as a member of a team.
- You will develop the ability to solve complex challenges.
- You will receive recognition by participating in GDE SCIBOTICS COMPETITION.

###### MISSION:

###### LIFE ON THE RED PLANET

###### HARDWARE: CUBROID OR SIMILAR

**DESCRIPTION**

Imagine living on another planet! Is there air to breathe? Is there water to drink? Is it hot or cold? Can
you identify any other problem. Solve this problem as you move from one Base to another. This
robotics challenge consists of programming a transporter to drive from BASE 1 to BASE 2
autonomously. You can move your robot in three stages. Stay on course! Watch out for the hazards!

**RESEARCH TOPIC**

What is it like to live in space or on another planet? Can you identify a problem with living in space? Can you
think of a solution to that problem? Can you build a model to help us understand your solution? Please refer to
the rubric for this challenge to help you better understand how to proceed.


**CHALLENGE RULES**

6. On the day of the competition you will get 15 minutes access to the competition table.
7. All 3 missions [and testing] must be completed within the 15 minutes.
8. Missions will be timed ... the fastest mission will be used for scoring.
9. The mission timer starts when the robot crosses the start laser beam, and stops when the
    robot crosses the end laser beam.
10. You can move the robot into the best position at the start of each stage by hand.
11. If robot fails a stage: begin a new mission [timer reset to zero] until 15 min runs out.
12. Teams are not allowed to use devices to remotely control the robot.
13. Programming device must be placed where the judges can see it.
14. You may wipe the maze with a slightly damp cloth.

###### MISSION:

###### THUNDERDROME

###### OPEN HARDWARE: SCIBOT and ARDUINO ROBOTS

**DESCRIPTION**

You were captain of an intergalactic troop ship on your way to THUNDERDROME on the dusty desert
planet MAGNATRON. On board your ship are highly trained reinforcements from the Fifth Legion. Your
space craft crashed when strong magnetic forces pulled you off course. Your mission is to build a land
transport from the wreckage of your spaceship and get to THUNDERDROME which is under attack
before it falls to the aliens. Hazards on the way include radiation storms and violent gangs.

**RESEARCH TOPIC**

Can you identify a problem people face in their communities, in space or on another planet? Can you
think of a solution to the problem you identified? Can you build a physical model to help us gain a
better understanding of your solution? Please refer to the rubric to understand how to proceed and
what the judges will be looking for on the day of the competition.


**CHALLENGE RULES**

1. Your team will consist of 1 robot and max 4 learners.
2. Before competition day build and program a DIY robot from electronic parts.
3. Program robot to move autonomously from the start to THUNDERDROME.
4. The robot must then return to the starting point autonomously.
5. Robot must start and end with wheels inside blocks.
6. If robot fails a stage: begin a new mission [timer reset to zero] until 15 min runs out.
7. On the day of the competition you will have 15 minutes access to the competition table.
8. Missions will be timed ... fastest mission of three will be used for scoring.
9. Timer starts when the robot triggers start beam, stops when robot crosses end beam.
10. Not allowed to use devices to remotely control the robot.
11. Programming device must be placed where the judges can observe it.
12. You may wipe the maze with a slightly damp cloth.
13. Permitted hardware is a DIY robot built from electronic parts.

###### SCIBOTICS CATEGORY 3: OPEN SOURCE [GRADE 10 – 11 ]

**MISSION TO THE YELLOW PLANET
OPEN HARDWARE: SCIBOT and ARDUINO ROBOTS**

**DESCRIPTION**

A princess from the Kingdom of Bidian, a powerful member of the Galaxy Federation was kidnapped
by a gang of criminal Woakies. They whisked Princess Alesia away to a secret location on the forbidden
YELLOW PLANET. The YELLOW PLANET has rocky outcrops that makes it very difficult to move around.

The Woakies are demanding a ransom of millions of sheekels for Princess Alesia. The Galaxy
Federation’s agents infiltrated the Woakies and know her exact location. Rescue her before the
Woakies realise they’ve been betrayed and move her to a new secret location.


**RESEARCH TOPIC**

What problems do people face in their communities, in space or on another planet? Where does
order come from, what laws apply? Can you think of a problem and what the solution to that
problem might be? Can you describe in detail a solution to that problem? Can you build a model to
help us gain a better understanding of how your solution works? Please refer to the rubric to
understand what the judges will be looking for.

**CHALLENGE RULES**

1. Your team consists of 1 robot and maximum 4 learners.
2. Mission is to build and program an autonomous robot and ‘rescue’ a LEGO minifigure.
3. The robot must move from HOME BASE to the HOSTAGE SITE autonomously.
4. Robot must return to HOME. No princess is mission failure.
5. Mission if performed in stages must start and end with wheels inside the blocks.
6. Team member will rescue the LEGO minifigure and place it on the robot.
7. Team member may position the robot optimally at begin of new stage.
8. If robot fails a stage: begin a new mission [timer reset to zero] until 15 min runs out.
9. Teams will have 15 minutes access to the competition table.
10. May attempt new missions until team’s allocated 15 minutes is up.
11. Mission electronically timed from start to end ... fastest mission used for scoring.
12. Teams are not allowed to use devices to remotely control the robot.
13. Programming device must be placed where the judges can observe it.

SCIBOTICS CATEGORY 4: INVENTOR JUNIOR [GRADE R – 3]
```
Have you ever entered a competition? It’s fun because you can make new friends and hang out with
clever kids like yourself who make stuff and have big dreams. Do you want to fly to the Moon or live
on Mars one day? Maybe you want to solve an everyday problem where you live on Earth.

To enter this category first identify a problem people are struggling with, something that poses a
challenge, or imagine a problem with living in space or on another planet. Think of a solution.

Make some drawings of your invention/solution. Once you have some drawings think about what you
are going to need to start building and testing.

Use any material to build your solution to the problem identified. If you are going to use a sharp knife
be very careful because you can cut yourself. Scissors are a lot safer, but you still need to be careful.
Get an adult to assist you when doing things like cutting where you can potentially cut yourself.

The next think you need to do, once your model or reduced scale replica is built, is to create some
story boards on project cardboard explaining how everything works and what it does, and what the
benefit to humankind will be if your invention goes into widespread use.

Next, you need to practice making a short presentation and speech about how everything works and
why you did it. Yes, we know that can be scary, but the judges in the competition are very kind and
have lots of experience working with young people like you. To prepare you should practice your
presentation a few times in front of your team members and with your teacher or coach.


**CHALLENGE RULES**

###### SCIBOTICS CATEGORY 4: INVENTOR [GRADE 4 – 7]

Have you ever entered a competition? It’s fun because you can meet new friends and hang out with
clever kids like yourself who like to make stuff.

To enter this category you first need to identify a problem and think about how to solve it.

Problem can be in your community, in space or on another planet.

The next thing to do is start by making some drawings of your invention. Once you have some drawings
think about what you are going to need to start building and testing.

Use any material to build your robot. If you are going to use a sharp knife be very careful because you
can cut yourself. Scissors are a lot safer, but you still need to be careful. Get an adult to assist you when
doing things like cutting where you can potentially cut yourself.

Once your model or reduced scale replica is built, create some story boards on project cardboard
explaining how everything works and what it does, and what the benefit to humankind will be if your
invention goes into widespread use. Practice making a short presentation about how everything works
and why you did it. Practice your presentation a few times in front of your team and coach.

**CHALLENGE RULES**

1. Your team consists of one project and maximum 4 learners.
2. Find a problem in your community or the society you live in.
3. Alternatively, a problem humans might encounter in space or on another planet.
4. Think about how you can potentially solve this problem.
5. Enter the GDE SCIBOTICS Competition in the INVENTOR category.
6. Register online for GDE SCIBOTICS.
7. Present an example of a working project.
8. Use any material to build your project.
9. Design and make some posters.
10. Explain how everything works.
11. What would it cost to make a working example of your invention?
12. List the benefits.
13. Rule changes may be required ... read the final rules at the competition.
