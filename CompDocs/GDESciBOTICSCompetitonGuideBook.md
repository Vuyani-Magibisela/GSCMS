### GDE SCIBOTICS 2025

**INTRODUCTION**

Practical competition challenge activities help the participants to learn about robotics and coding with
absolutely no difficulty because it’s exciting and fun. GDE SCIBOTICS Competition exposes youth from
underserviced communities to engineering problem solving and exciting challenges.

The competition takes place every year in September, and it’s called GDE SciBOTICS because it’s all
about science fiction. Remember, what’s impossible today often becomes the reality of tomorrow. In
1903 when the Wright brothers made their first flight at Kitty Hawk North Carolina, USA, some believed
it would take another 1000 years for humans to learn how to fly ... who would have thought humans
would land on the Moon a few short decades later and send equipment to explore Mars?

We want you to think about living in entirely new realms, our large scale models of colonies in space
on distant planets are designed to get you, the learner, to start thinking about what might be needed
to survive far away from our home planet, and what we can do to live sustainably on Earth.

The Gauteng Department of Education SciBOTICS Competition at Sci-Bono Discovery Centre, has been
designed to touch your life in a positive way with benefits that will help you right through your tertiary
education. We hope to see you at the GDE SciBOTICS in 2025, a competition that is quickly going to
become the most important STEM education event of the year. What you learn by participating in
SCIBOTICS will open doors for you, and could be the key to your exciting maths and science career.

Benefits of getting involved in the GDE SCIBOTICS competition:

- You will experience writing and uploading program code from a computer to a robot.
- You will build and program a world class Arduino robot from electronic parts.
- You will participate in an exciting robotics challenge as a member of a team.
- You will become a star as you develop the ability to solve complex challenges.
- You will receive recognition by participating in GDE SCIBOTICS COMPETITION.

###### MISSION:

###### LOST IN SPACE

###### HARDWARE: LEGO SPIKE OR SIMILAR

**DESCRIPTION**
You are lost in space. You ejected from the Intergalactic Federation Space Station in the fourth
quadrant of our galaxy after it was hit by asteroids. Your emergency space capsule landed on the
surface of a deep purple planet in the outer rim of our Galaxy. You sent out a distress signal and the
Federation dispatched a rescue craft that’s waiting to pick you up.

The mission is to find your way from the START to the rescue ship at the END but you’ve also been
receiving desperate messages from another space capsule that escaped the space station, so your
mission includes rescuing your space buddies by collecting their space capsule on the way. There are
huge mountainous barriers between you and your rescue so travel around these obstacles to prevent
damage to your terrestrial robot.

**RESEARCH TOPIC**

What happens when an asteroid or space junk hits a space station? What is an asteroid? Where does
space junk come from? How can astronauts protect themselves if something happens to their space
station? Design and build a model of an escape capsule that six astronauts can use to get away from a
space station that is breaking up.

###### MISSION:

###### THUNDERDROME

###### OPEN HARDWARE: SCIBOT and ARDUINO ROBOTS

**DESCRIPTION**

You were captain of an intergalactic troop ship on your way to THUNDERDROME on the dusty desert
planet MAGNATRON. On board your ship are highly trained reinforcements from the Fifth Legion. Your
space craft crashed when strong magnetic forces pulled you off course. Your mission is to build a land
transport from the wreckage of your space ship and get to THUNDERDROME which is under attack
before it falls to the aliens. Hazards on the way include radiation storms and violent gangs.

**RESEARCH TOPIC**

How do we get around on another planet? Do some research around how humans have explored the
Moon and more distant planets like Mars using land-based vehicles and design and build a prototype
of a vehicle that can move six astronauts around in comfort and safety.


**CHALLENGE RULES**

1. Your team will consist of 1 robot and max 4 learners.
2. Before the competition day build and program a robot from electronic parts.
3. Program robot to move autonomously from the start to THUNDERDROME [end].
4. The robot must return to the starting point autonomously.
5. Robot must start and end with wheels inside start and end blocks.
6. On the day of the competition you will have 15 minutes access to the competition table.
7. The missions will each be timed ... fastest mission of three will be used for scoring.
8. Timer starts when the robot crosses the start beam stops when the robot returns.
9. Not allowed to use devices to remotely control the robot.
10. Programming device must be placed where the judges can observe it.
11. You may wipe the maze with a slightly damp cloth.
12. If a mission fails another mission may be attempted ... within the 15 min table time limit.
13. Permitted hardware is a robot built from electronic parts.
14. Touching the robot during autonomous operation gets maximum mission time.
15. Navigation aid in the maze consists of a white line [with turns not exceeding 135 degrees].

OPEN HARDWARE: SCIBOT and ARDUINO ROBOTS**

**DESCRIPTION**

A princess from the Kingdom of Bidian, a powerful member of the Galaxy Federation was kidnapped
by a gang of criminal Woakies. They whisked her away to a secret location on the forbidden YELLOW
PLANET. The YELLOW PLANET has rocky outcrops that makes it very difficult to move around.

The Woakies are demanding a ransom of millions of sheekels for Princess Alesia. The Galaxy
Federation’s agents infiltrated the Woakies and know her exact location. Rescue her before the
Woakies realise they’ve been betrayed and move her somewhere else.


**RESEARCH TOPIC**

What is a computer algorithm? What is the LEFT HAND ON THE MAZE WALL ALGORITHM and how
does it work? Give basic explanations of machine learning and AI and where this technology might
benefit humankind. What examples of AI are already in everyday use and is it good or bad for humans?
Identify a problem in your community and describe a solution that you think can address this problem.
Build a model or prototype of your solution.

**CHALLENGE RULES**

###### SCIBOTICS CATEGORY 4: INVENTOR JUNIOR [GRADE R

- 3 ]

Have you ever entered a competition? It’s fun because you can make new friends and hang out with
clever kids like yourself who make stuff and have big dreams. Do you want to fly to the Moon or live
on Mars one day? Start reading and watch science videos and build what you will need to live in space.

To enter this category you first need to think about and decide what you are going to make. Unless of
course you already have some great ideas. The next thing to do is start by making some drawings of
your invention or inventions because you can have more than one. Once you have some drawings think
about what you are going to need to start building and testing.

Use any material to build your Robot. If you are going to use a sharp knife be very careful because you
can cut yourself. Scissors are a lot safer, but you still need to be careful. Get an adult to assist you when
doing things like cutting where you can potentially cut yourself.

The next think you need to do, once your model or reduced scale replica is built, is to create some
story boards on project cardboard explaining how everything works and what it does, and what the
benefit to humankind will be if your invention goes into widespread use.

Next, you need to practice making a short presentation and speech about how everything works and
why you did it. Yes, we know that can be scary, but the judges in the competition are very kind and
have lots of experience working with young people like you. To prepare you should practice your
presentation a few times in front of your team members and with your teacher or coach.


**CHALLENGE RULES**

1. Your team consists of one project and maximum 4 learners.
2. Find a problem in your community or society you live in.
3. Think about how you can potentially solve this problem.
4. Enter the GDE SCIBOTICS Competition in the INVENTOR category.
5. Register online for GDE SCIBOTICS.
6. Build a working model that solves the problem.
7. Design and make some marketing posters.
8. Explain how everything works.
9. Apply your mind as to what it would cost to make a working example of your invention.
10. List the benefits to your community and the planet.
11. Changes may be required ... please make sure you read the final rules at the competition.

###### SCIBOTICS CATEGORY 4: INVENTOR [GRADE 4 – 7]

Have you ever entered a competition. It’s fun because you can meet new friends and hang out with
clever kids like yourself who like to make stuff. To enter this category you first need to think about and
decide what you are going to make. The next thing to do is start by making some drawings of your
invention or inventions because you can have more than one. Once you have some drawings think
about what you are going to need to start building and testing.

Use any material to build your robot. If you are going to use a sharp knife be very careful because you
can cut yourself. Scissors are a lot safer, but you still need to be careful. Get an adult to assist you when
doing things like cutting where you can potentially cut yourself.

The next think you need to do, once your model or reduced scale replica is built, is to create some
story boards on project cardboard explaining how everything works and what it does, and what the
benefit to humankind will be if your invention goes into widespread use. Practice making a short
presentation about how everything works and why you did it. Yes, we know that can be scary so to
prepare you should practice your presentation a few times in front of your team and coach.

**CHALLENGE RULES**

1. Your team consists of one project and maximum 4 learners.
2. Find a problem in your community or society you live in.
3. Think about how you can potentially solve this problem.
4. Enter the GDE SCIBOTICS Competition in the INVENTOR category.
5. Register online for GDE SCIBOTICS.
6. Present an example(s) of a working project.
7. Use any material to build your project.
8. Design and make some marketing posters.
9. Explain how everything works.
10. Apply your mind as to what it would cost to make a working example of your invention.
11. List the benefits to your community and the planet.
12. Changes may be required so please make sure you read the final rules at the competition.
